Style
ADD SPACES INBETWEEN STUFF
```javascript


```
ALL WAYS USE DOUBLE SPACES, tabs are cancer: tabs are the number one preventable cause of death among programmers
ALL WAYS USE SEMI COLONS, even though javascript automatically inserts it, let's do it to make us sane
ALL WAYS USE COMMENTS, use it like this
```javascript
//This function inserts HTML into website
function insertHTML () {
  ...
}

//This function kicks your ass
function kickass () {
  ...
}
```

Make code simple, elegant, and consistent, and make sure to make separate functions and heirarchy instead a jumble of messy code.
